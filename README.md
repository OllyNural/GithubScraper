# GithubScraper

## Ideas
Look at API, see if there's a way to view all files in a repo, or a pre-build spider for static analysis

Scrape Github page file by file, and keep going down folders and building up a map locally

Look into how Code Climate does it - they have an engine which this can potentially hook into: [Github repo here](https://github.com/codeclimate/spec/blob/master/SPEC.md)
